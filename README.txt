Hello! this is an game i am currently developing while streaming on twitch (https://www.twitch.tv/ashcrysis)
it is suposed to be an farming gaming, but i am still working on core logics for simple topdown games with an survivalish aspect.

right now we have an simple inventory that is composed by 3 itens (predetermined, the player is still not able to pick up any itens or drop it and change the inventory content)
, we have an animator handler that can easily handle any itens we may want to make the player hold, and also an save mechanic that saves and loads the player position and last item index according to an txt file on the player machine.
for now thats it! feel free to use the code on what you need or want to, its free to use, but credits are appreciated <3
